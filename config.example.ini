; This configuration file enables configuring OpenPLC capabilities
; when the OpenPLC runtime starts. These capabilities can be configured
; without using the web front end and enable running the OpenPLC runtime
; standalone.
;
; This file must be located in the "etc" folder and must be named
; "config.ini".

[logging]

; Level defines the minimum level for a message to appear
; as a log message. Messages are a lower level are not
; output.
;
; Level may be one of the following values, ordered from
; lowest to highest:
;   trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = info

; ---------------------------------------------------------
; ---------------------------------------------------------
[interactive]
; The interactive server is what connects the web front end to the runtime
; You need this enabled if you want to be able to enable/disable services
; at runtime, view logs, etc.
;
; If you set this value to false and use the OpenPLC web interface to
; start the runtime, the web interface will not be able to communicate
; with the runtime.
enabled = true

[modbusslave]
; Modbus slave enables reading and writing located variables through the
; modbus interface. This starts a Modbus server (also know as a slave)
; running in the OpenPLC runtime.
enabled = false

; TCP Settings
; ------------
port = 502
address = 127.0.0.1

; How we bind located variables to modbus registers.
; This may be one of:
;   sized - indicates to use the size of a located variable to determine
;           the register type
binding = sized

; ---------------------------------------------------------

[modbusmaster]
; Modbus master enables reading and writing located variables through the
; modbus interface. This starts capabilities to poll one or more Modbus
; servers and exchange data with the located variables.

enabled = false

; We support multiple Modbus masters. Each master should specify
; a complete set of configuration information within this section.
; Different masters are identified by a postfix which includes the
; index of the master. Indices start at 0 and go up from there.

; A user defined name for the connection. This name appears in log messages.
; name.0 = 1

; How long to wait for a response before indicating an error.
; Measured in microseconds.
; response_timeout.0 = 100000
; The rate at which to poll the server. Measured in microseconds.
; The actual poll rate may be greater than this depending on response times
; from the remote server and availability of resources on the local host.
; poll_interval.0 = 250000

; The protocol to use for connection. This value must be one of:
;   tcp
;   rtu
; If you set this to any other value, then this configuration item group
; is not created. You might use this to disable connecting to a particular
; Modbus slave.
; protocol.0 = tcp

; When there are communication failures, should we keep trying
; or backoff intelligently. The default behaviour is no backoff
; but you can specify one of the following:
;
;   none - Same as default, no strategy.
;   linear_bounded - Back off linearly based on the number of
;                    failed attempts. Bounded to 10x the poll
;                    interval.

[pstorage]
; The pstorage service reads and writes persistent storage. It enables
; the runtime to restore important variables to the previous value
; if the runtime is restarted.
